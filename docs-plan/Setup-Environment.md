Setup Test Environment Outline

To set up a test environment for PowerShell, you'll need to follow several key steps:

## Installation and Setup

**Install Pester Testing Framework**
Install the Pester module, which is the primary testing framework for PowerShell, by running:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name Pester -Force -SkipPublisherCheck
Import-Module Pester -PassThru
```[7][8]

## Testing Environment Structure

**Create Test Files**
- Name your test files with the `.Tests.ps1` extension
- Store your test scripts in a dedicated testing directory[7]

**Basic Test Structure**
```powershell
Describe "Your Test Suite Name" {
    Context "Test Scenario" {
        It "should perform specific action" {
            $result = Your-Command
            $result | Should -Be ExpectedValue
        }
    }
}
```

## Development Tools

**PowerShell ISE**
Use PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) which provides:
- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-completion
- Error checking
- Breakpoint functionality
- Step-by-step execution capabilities[9]

## Best Practices

**Code Organization**
- Use proper indentation and spacing
- Implement consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for cmdlets, camelCase for variables)
- Enable strict mode using `Set-StrictMode`
- Implement error handling with Try-Catch-Finally blocks[9]

**Testing Components**
- Use `Describe` blocks to define test groups
- Implement `Context` blocks for different scenarios
- Create individual tests with `It` blocks
- Use `Should` assertions for validations[4]

Remember to run your tests in an isolated environment to prevent any impact on production systems[2]. This setup will allow you to effectively develop and test PowerShell scripts while maintaining code quality and reliability.


## Powershell Preview

PowerShell Preview offers a way to test new features and functionality alongside your stable PowerShell installation. Here's how to set it up:

## Installation Methods

**Using Winget**
```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell.Preview --source winget
```

**Side-by-Side Installation**
The preview version installs to `$env:ProgramFiles\PowerShell\7-preview`, allowing it to run alongside your stable PowerShell installation[7].

## Key Features

**Preview Extension for VS Code**
- Provides enhanced command-line scripting capabilities
- Built on .NET Standard for simplified code structure
- Includes PSReadLine support for Windows
- Offers syntax coloring and multi-line editing[4]

## Important Considerations

**Environment Path**
- Preview version doesn't automatically add `pwsh.exe` to system-wide environment variables
- You may need to manually modify PATH if you want the preview version available system-wide[3]

**Version Management**
- Preview and stable versions can coexist on the same system
- Use the preview version when testing new features
- Use stable version when you need reliable `pwsh` command-line functionality[3]

If you encounter any issues with the preview version interfering with your stable installation, you can perform a repair installation of the stable version to restore proper functionality[5].

Windows Sandbox provides an excellent isolated environment for testing PowerShell scripts safely. Here's how to set it up:

## Installation

**Enable Windows Sandbox**

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName "Containers-DisposableClientVM" -All -Online
```

After running this command, restart your computer[1][4].

## Configuration

**Create a Configuration File**
Create a `.wsb` file with the following XML structure:
```xml
<Configuration>
    <MappedFolders>
        <MappedFolder>
            <HostFolder>C:\YourScriptFolder</HostFolder>
            <ReadOnly>true</ReadOnly>
        </MappedFolder>
    </MappedFolders>
    <LogonCommand>
        <Command>powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</Command>
    </LogonCommand>
</Configuration>
```[2]

## Key Features

**Environment Properties**
- Creates a temporary, isolated Windows environment
- All changes are discarded when closed
- Provides a fresh instance each time
- Completely separated from the host system[7]

**Customization Options**
- Map folders from host machine
- Configure memory allocation
- Enable/disable networking
- Set up automatic script execution on startup[5]

## Best Practices

**Security Considerations**
- Use read-only folder mapping for testing scripts
- Keep network disabled when testing potentially harmful code
- Create separate test configurations for different scenarios[3]

Remember that everything in the sandbox is temporary and will be deleted upon closing, making it perfect for testing PowerShell scripts without risking your main system[7].
